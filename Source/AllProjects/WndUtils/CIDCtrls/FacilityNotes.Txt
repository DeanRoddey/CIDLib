Z-Order
-------------------------
Window's Z-Order concepts are really bad, backwards and confusing as documented. To avoid going around and around, here is how it works, relative to our view.

Our View is that the window farther from the viewer is the bottom-most window, the one closest is the top-most, i.e. it covers anything else that it intersects. Controls are created in their order in the resource files, and each new one is closer to the user than the ones before (higher in the zorder in our world, where they are numbered 0 for the farthest to X for the closest.)

Windows' view is GW_HWNDLAST gets our topmost (closest) window and GW_CHILD/GW_HWNDFIRST gets our bottom-most (farthest) window. 

GW_HWNDPREV moves from our front (closest) to our back (farthest.) Windows calls that the window 'above' the passed one, but in our world it's the window below the current one.

GW_HWNDNEXT moves from our back to front so the opposite from above. Windows calls that the window 'below' the passed one, but in our world it's the window above the current one.


In our TWindow class:

pwndNextChild() gets the next closer one (higher z-order in our world.)
pwndPrevChild() gets the next further one away from us.
pwndBottomChild() gets the farther one away
pwndTopChild() gets the closest one to us.
